# REDvsBLUE-PROJECT
In this project, I was given a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I had to play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.As the Red Team, I had to attack a company's vulnerable VM within my environment, which ultimately gave me root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I had to use Kibana to review logs that were taken during the attack. Finally, I had to interpret the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.

2) REDVSBLUEDAY2.pdf : This file shows the blue team process to review logs and mitigation measures that I would suggest to that company.
3) CAPSTONEENGAGEMENT: This is the capstone engagement file that culminates all of the findings and summarizes them.
